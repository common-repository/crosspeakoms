Easy eCommerce Order Management

== Description ==

This plugin integrates your existing WooCommerce store with CrossPeak OMS.

CrossPeak is a SaaS product that extends the order management functionality of WooCommerce.
The granular permissions environment enables completely separate user access and visibility for distinct workflows â€” outsourced or in-house customer service, warehouse or 3PL fulfillment and multi-level business management.

CrossPeak is designed to deliver a great customer experience for companies with virtual and flex inventory products.

Unlike other OMS products, CrossPeak is not a warehouse management tool, it is focused on delivering a connected customer experience after the sale of any virtual or unique inventory product through a permission based workflow. Customer Services, Call Center, 3PL partners and management teams all enjoy different levels of access to the same order data to provide a customer first ecosystem.
